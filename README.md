# Data Centric Development - Milestone Project 3

### Data Centric Development Project

In my Data Centric Development Project I made a Vehicle database that could be used for a Car Dealer or something along those lines,It allows you to easily add, edit, and delete vehicles, 
and manufacturers.It also allows you to easily sort the table from A/Z or 1-9 by simply clicking on the tables header

## UX DESIGN

This application is for data logging all the vehicles the client owns or uses,You can also easily filter through and search through all the vehicles in the database.

## User Stories:

- As a User I want to be able to easily navigate through our inventory of vehicles.
- As a User I want to search for a vehicle and see all the information that's saved for that vehicle.

### Features Used in This Project:

- Being able to search for any vehcile in the database.
- Add,Edit, and Delete vehciles to the database.
- Add,Edit, and Delete Manufacturers to the database.
- Sort the information in the database by A/Z

### The Technologies I Have Used:

- **[Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)** - I used Mongodb for my database
- **[Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)** - I used Heroku to deploy my project **[Here](https://vehicle-log-flask.herokuapp.com/)**.
- **[Python Flask Framework](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)** 
- **[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)** - I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes for my project **[Here](https://github.com/Azza434/DCD-Milestone-Project/tree/master/Wireframes)**.

## TESTING

I conducted tests on a wide selction of browsers/devices to ensure User's can successfully use the site and it's features.

Tests conducted:

- Checking the functionality of the Google Maps Api, making sure everything worked as it should
- Making sure the code runs wihtout issues using the **[Google Chrome Inspect](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts)** Tools.
Inside Chromes Dev Tools I can:
    - Check the responsiveness for individual phones and screens, example, an IPhone/Samsung.
    - Use the console to check the stability of my **[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)** files so that there is no errors and it is not broken.
    - I can also change and adapt my code inside the Tools, to see what works and what doesn't. Also staying aware that these changes I make are not permenant.

Here is each Validator used:

- **[HTML](https://html5.validator.nu/)**
- **[CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**
- **[JavaScript](http://esprima.org/demo/validate.html)**


These tests included browsers/devices:

- Edge - Windows Computer
- Mozilla - Windows Computer
- Chrome - Windows Computer and iPhone
- Safari - iPhone
- Internet Explorer - Windows Computer

### User Stories Testing

- "As a User I want to be able to easily navigate through our inventory of vehicles" 
**I tested this by clicking on the Table header of the table and it returning all the data orginized from A/Z.**
- "As a User I want to search for a vehicle and see all the information that's saved for that vehicle" 
**I tested this by using the search functionality.**

## DEPLOYMENT

I have been commiting every finished functionality, and every bug fix, to GitHub using **[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/)**.

I have fully deployed this application to GitHub Pages which can be found **[Here](https://github.com/Azza434/DCD-Milestone-Project)**.

I have fully deployed this application to Heroku which can be found **[Here](https://vehicle-log-flask.herokuapp.com/)**.
